**Problem:**  
Many people are interested in environmental sustainability but feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of advice. They want to take responsibility and make a positive impact, but are unsure how to translate interest into consistent, meaningful action.

- Users can track progress, see their impact, and engage with buddies for shared actions, reducing feelings of overwhelm.  

**Key Features:**  
1. Curated sustainability news from multiple sources.  
2. Summaries and “Why it matters” insights for quick understanding.  
3. Actionable steps derived from the news.  
4. Add these steps to a personal or community to-do list.  
5. Pre-categorized tasks: **personal** vs **community**.  
6. Users can add custom tasks.  
7. Progress tracking with a visual progress bar.  
8. Simple toggle to mark tasks as completed.
